## Overview
InsightBot is an advanced AI-powered custom visual for Microsoft Power BI that leverages large language model APIs to provide conversational data analysis and insights. This enterprise-grade solution enables users to interact with their data through natural language queries, enhancing data exploration and business intelligence capabilities.

## System Requirements

### Software Requirements 
- **Power BI Desktop**: Latest version recommended, minimum 2023 release

- Corporate proxy settings that permit external AI service connections

## Implementation

### Installation
1. Import the InsightBot custom visual from the Power BI Marketplace
2. Add the visual to your report canvas
3. Configure data bindings to connect the visual to your dataset
4. Set up API authentication in the visual properties panel

### Configuration

#### API Integration
- **Provider Selection**: Choose from supported LLM providers or connect to your organization's private API endpoint
- **API Authentication**: Enter your API key in the secure credential manager
- **Model Selection**: Specify which model to use based on your performance and capability requirements
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Enter the complete API endpoint URL from your provider's documentation

#### Context Management
- **Data Explorer**: Navigate the data context panel to view which tables and fields will be used to respond to queries
- **Context Limitation**: Set maximum token limit for context (recommended: 2000+ tokens for optimal responses)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Customize system prompts to guide the AI's behavior and response format

#### Visual Customization

- Configure temperature settings based on need for creativity vs. precision

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
| Error Message | Probable Cause | Resolution |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| "API Key is missing" | No API key provided in configuration | Navigate to API settings and enter a valid key |
| "Invalid API Key" | Expired or incorrect API key | Verify and update API key in settings |
| "Authentication failed" | Permission issues with API provider | Check subscription status and permissions |

### Connectivity Problems
| Error Message | Probable Cause | Resolution |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| "Network connection lost" | Internet connectivity issues | Verify network connection and proxy settings |
| "Error Communicating with AI service" | Endpoint unavailability or timeout | Verify endpoint URL and try an alternative provider |
| "Bad request" | Incorrect model specification or API parameters | Confirm model name and parameter format in configuration |

### Response Quality Issues
| Symptoms | Probable Cause | Resolution |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Inaccurate analysis | Insufficient context | Increase token limit and improve prompt engineering |
| Incomplete responses | Token limit constraints | Adjust maximum response token settings |
| Irrelevant answers | Poor context understanding | Refine system prompt to better define expected analysis |
