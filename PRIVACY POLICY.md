## Privacy Policy

*Version 2.0 | July 2025*

---

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how Nexora Labs ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use InsightBot, our AI-powered custom visual for Microsoft Power BI ("Software"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparent data practices while delivering powerful analytical capabilities.

## 2. Information Collection

### 2.1 Information You Provide
When using InsightBot, we collect:
- Text queries submitted to the chatbot interface
- Data context from connected Power BI datasets
- API configuration details necessary for service operation
- User feedback and error reports when voluntarily submitted

### 2.2 Information We Do Not Collect
- We do not persistently store the content of your analytical conversations
- We do not collect personal information beyond what is necessary for service provision
- We do not access underlying Power BI datasets beyond the scope granted by your configuration

## 3. Data Processing and Usage

### 3.1 Our Role as an Intermediary
InsightBot functions primarily as a secure bridge between your Power BI environment and selected Language Model API Providers. Our role is to:
- Format your data queries appropriately for the selected AI service
- Transmit queries securely to the configured Language Model API
- Return responses to your Power BI environment

### 3.2 Data Transmission Process
When you interact with InsightBot:
1. Your query and relevant data context are processed within your Power BI environment
2. This information is securely transmitted to the configured Language Model API Provider
3. The provider generates a response based on your query
4. The response is returned to InsightBot for display within your Power BI report

### 3.3 Enterprise Data Handling
For enterprise deployments, we offer:
- Option to use private API endpoints that maintain your organization's data sovereignty
- Configuration controls to limit what data context is shared with Language Model APIs
- Compliance with Microsoft Power BI's security and governance frameworks

## 4. Data Sharing

### 4.1 Third-Party Language Model Providers
Your queries and associated data context are shared with your selected Language Model API Provider(s). Each provider maintains its own privacy policy governing data handling practices:
- When using public AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, etc.), their respective privacy policies apply
- When using your organization's self-hosted models, your internal data policies apply

### 4.2 Microsoft Power BI Platform
As a custom visual operating within the Power BI environment, usage of InsightBot is subject to Microsoft's privacy policies and data handling practices for Power BI.

### 4.3 Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. We limit such disclosures to what is legally necessary.

## 5. Data Retention

### 5.1 Transient Processing
We employ a transient processing model:
- Query data exists only for the duration needed to process your request
- No conversation history is retained on our systems after session completion
- Temporary caching may occur only as needed for performance optimization

### 5.2 Optional Logging
For enterprise deployments, optional diagnostic logging may be enabled:
- Logs contain metadata about queries (time, status, performance metrics)
- Logs do not contain the actual content of queries or responses
- Log retention periods are configurable to meet your compliance requirements

## 6. Security Measures

### 6.1 Data in Transit
- All communications between InsightBot and Language Model APIs use TLS 1.2+ encryption
- API keys are encrypted in transit and at rest
- Authentication credentials are securely managed through Power BI's credential management system

### 6.2 Access Controls
- Access to any operational systems is strictly limited to authorized personnel
- All access is logged and regularly audited
- Multi-factor authentication is enforced for administrative access

## 7. Your Data Rights

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your information:

- **Access**: Request information about how your data is used
- **Correction**: Request correction of inaccurate data
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of applicable data
